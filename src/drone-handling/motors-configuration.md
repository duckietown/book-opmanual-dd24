# Configure motor spinning direction

Now you have to set up the motor spinning direction on the flight controller in QGroundControl.

```{admonition} What you will need
:class: note

* A base station computer
* QGroundControl installed on your computer.
* Flight Controller with correct firmware and parameters.
* Your drone's motors and ESCs connected properly to the flight controller.
```


```{admonition} What you will get

* A Flight Controller configured for flight.
```

### Steps:

#### 1. Connect Flight Controller to QGroundControl
    - Connect your SpeedyBee F405 v3 flight controller to your computer using a USB cable.
    - Open QGroundControl.
    - Follow the instructions in the [flight controller initialization](qgroundcontrol-connection) to connect to the flight controller from your laptop.


#### 2. Check Motor Outputs
    ```{caution}
    Remove propellers for safety before proceeding with motor testing.
    ```

    - Go to the `Motors` tab in QGroundControl. This section will allow you to test motor outputs individually.

        ```{image} ../_images/fc-setup/motor_setup_tab.png
        Motor testing tab
        ```

    - Test each motor by clicking on the individual motor numbers (1, 2, 3, 4). Ensure each motor spins in the correct direction according to the BetaflightX frame diagram:
        
        - Motor 1 (B): `Clockwise (CW)
        - Motor 2 (A): `Counterclockwise (CCW)
        - Motor 3 (C): `Clockwise (CW)
        - Motor 4 (D): `Counterclockwise (CCW)`

        ```{image} ../_images/fc-setup/reference_spinning_direction.png
        :name: betaflightx-spinning-dir

        BetaflightX frame type spinning directions
        ```

        ```{important}
        Notice that there is a different naming scheme between the motor numbering and the motor test tab:

            - The motor test tab uses **letters** (A, B, C, D)
            - The motor configuration parameters use numbers (1,2,3,4)
        ```

#### 3. Reverse Motor Direction (if required)
If any motor is spinning in the wrong direction, you'll need to reverse its direction:
   
    - Go to the `Parameters` tab.
    - In the search bar, type `SERVO_BLH_RVMASK`.
    - Click on it and select the motor (here the configurator refers to `Channels` so motor `i` will correspond to `Channeli`) to reverse based on the [required direction](betaflightx-spinning-dir).

        ```{figure} ../_images/fc-setup/esc_reverse_direction.png
        :name: motor-reverse-configurator

        Configuration tab of the `SERVO_BLH_RVMASK` to reverse individual motors.
        ```

    - Click on `Save` and when prompted reboot the flight controller.

#### 4. Verify Motor Spin Direction
    - After making any changes, retest each motor through the `Motors` tab in QGroundControl to ensure all motors are spinning in the correct direction.
    - Make sure the motor directions match the BetaflightX frame configuration.

#### 5. Save
    - Once all motors are spinning in the correct direction, save the settings in QGroundControl.

This completes the setup of the flight controller.
