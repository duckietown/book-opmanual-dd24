# Instructions


## Flight Controller soldering
While the Flight Controller has its own section you will solder it here.

Take the Flight Controller out of its plastic casing, exposing both sides of the PCB.

### Soldering the pins
```{admonition} TODO
Do we have 90 degrees pins being shipped?

Also since we have two versions of FC we should have tabs with both

Add FC version identification step
```

Solder the short edge of the 90 degree pins to the flight controller.

```{attention} Be sure that the direction you solder the pins into the board is exactly as shown in the images 
```

[TODO: ADD FC WITH SOLDERED PINS PICTURE]

### Solder the battery monitor pins to the flight controller

[TODO: this is wrong, we don't solder directly to the board but rather use pin headers]

Pick the the 6 pins header that came in the Flight Controller wiring and use pliers to break off a 2 pins connect.

Solder the 2 pins connector to the flight controller, as shown in the image below (select your Flight Controller version in the tab).

Battery leads connection to Flight Controller [TODO: REDO PIC AND ADD FOR BOTH FC TYPES]
```
