# Excluded materials

## Base station (Laptop)

This section contains what you will need to build and fly your drone that is not included in the kit.
In order to fly the drone, you must have a laptop or personal computer that is capable of connecting to the internet.

### OS requirements
At this time, it is not possible to flash your SD card on a Chromebook. You will need a Linux, Windows, or macOS device to configure the SD card during the build, but you can use any OS after this the configuration.

### Browser Requirements
**Google Chrome is recommended**. You will need to download a Chrome app later on, so it is best to install Chrome now (other chromium-based browsers should work too but are untested). Safari will work for *flying only*. Microsoft Edge (Classic) does not work (the new chromium-based Edge will).

### Software requirements
Additionally, you will need to install the following software on your base station.

1. [Cleanflight Configurator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cleanflight-configurator/enacoimjcgeinfnnnpajinjgmkahmfgb?hl=en). This is a Google Chrome application that will allow you to setup your flight controller.

2. [USB to UART driver](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers). (**macOS and Windows only**) Download the correct driver for your OS. You will not need this driver if you are using a Chromebook or Linux, you will be able to connect to the flight controller without it.
