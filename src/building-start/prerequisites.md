# Prerequisites

This section contains information about the most important skills used in the build. 

```{important}
Whether you're new to soldering or not, we recommend reading through this page to review the basic techniques used in the build.

## Strip Wires

Stripping is the process of removing a portion of an insulator from a wire in order to expose its strands. It is done by using a wire stripper. The exposed wire is then able to be tinned and soldered.

## Tin

Tinning is the process of applying solder to exposed wire or metal pad. It is done by using a soldering iron to heat up the metal, and then solder melts into the wire or onto the pad. The purpose of Tinning is to make the soldering process easier.

### Tinning a Wire
Watch the following tutorial to learn how to tin and join two wires.

```{note}
Sometimes parts will have wires already tinned out-of-the-box by the manufacturer (i.e. pre-tinned). You can identify this by: 
1. The "shininess" of the tip of a wire 
2. The inability to fray the wire strands of the tip of a wire. 

However, such tinning is often ineffective. Cut off any pre-tinned tips, then strip and tin the part yourself.

## Soldering

Soldering is the process of joining two metal components by melting an alloy; namely, solder. Since solder is conductive, the resulting joint acts as a bridge for electricity traveling between the two metal components.

Below, there are brief resources on soldering, please review them before starting the build.

```{caution}
* Be careful holding wires and components with your bare hands while soldering, as they will get very hot very quickly. We recommend using long-nose pliers or helping hands whenever possible.

* Don't touch the soldering iron tip (or any other metal piece) while the soldering iron is on, since doing so can cause burns. If you get burned, rinse the affected area with cold water immediately.


* Likewise, don't use the soldering iron on anything you don't intend to solder. The high heat will cause things to melt/burn.


* Don't breathe soldering fumes; use a soldering fan whenever possible.

## Basics of electrical circuits

We recommend that you get an introduction to electrical circuits  like the ones you will be creating before starting the build.
